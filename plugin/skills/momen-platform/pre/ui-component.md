# UI components & layout

## Component Domain Knowledge
The UI is a tree of components organized into pages.

### Identity & Tree Rules
Every component has an immutable id and a displayName. Reads return both; write tools verify the {id, displayName} pair and reject a mismatch — re-read, then retry. A container's children order IS the visual order. A component can never be moved into its own subtree.

### Categories
Layout (container — can hold other components via `children`):
- PAGE: root of each page; created without a parent and registered as a new page.
- LAYOUT_VIEW: generic Flexbox container; the most common container.
- MODAL: popup/dialog container; created without a parent, opened/closed via events.

Special (complex — children live in built-in slots seeded at creation and mutated only via the slot tools, never via ADD_COMPONENT / MOVE_COMPONENTS):
- LIST: repeating list; its "cell" slot renders once per data row (optional header/footer).
- TAB_VIEW: tabbed interface; one child view per tab in tabList.
- SELECT_VIEW: built-in normal/selected state views.
- CONDITIONAL_VIEW: one built-in view per condition branch.
- MAP: optional "marker" slot taking a MAP_MARKER.

Leaf/Business (cannot have children): BUTTON, TEXT, IMAGE, VIDEO, LOTTIE, RICH_TEXT, TEXT_INPUT, NUMBER_INPUT, VIDEO_PICKER, FILE_PICKER, SWITCH, MAP_MARKER, CALENDAR, HORIZONTAL_LINE, SHEET, HTML, RICH_TEXT_EDITOR, MIX_IMAGE_PICKER, DATE_TIME_PICKER, DATA_SELECTOR, PROGRESS_BAR. MAP_MARKER can only be placed inside MAP. `GET_SELECTABLE_COMPONENT_TYPES` returns the full creatable catalog with each type's slot fields.

### Hierarchy Rules
Every component except PAGE and MODAL must have a Layout Component as its parent. Prefer relative positioning; use absolute/fixed only when truly necessary.

### Layout
Momen uses Flexbox. Layout containers configure: direction (row/column), justify-content (start, space-between, space-evenly, space-around), gap, wrap, overflow (scroll/visible/hidden).

### Responsive Breakpoints
Phone: 0–767 px (375 px panel) | Tablet: 768–1279 px (820 px panel) | Desktop: 1280–1920 px (1440 px panel). Desktop is the primary breakpoint and the one every read and write defaults to. A narrower breakpoint stores only its differences from desktop, so a field it does not override renders the desktop value at that width — an app built without touching phone is not unstyled there, it is desktop-sized there, which is how a 600 px card ends up running off a 375 px screen. Nothing fails: the schema is valid, the error center stays clean, and the only symptom is what the user sees on a phone. So a page is not finished at desktop. Read what phone actually resolves to by passing `breakpoint` to `GET_COMPONENT_INFO` and `GET_CONTAINER_CHILDREN_INFO`; the read names which fields that breakpoint overrides and which it inherits. Fix one by resending that field with the `breakpoint` param to `UPDATE_COMPONENT_STYLE` — usually flexDirection 'column' on rows, and widths in % or fill rather than px — and have the user confirm the phone breakpoint in the editor. Resending a value unchanged at a breakpoint pins it there and stops it following desktop, so override only what has to differ. The closing check at the end of a turn names any component that cannot fit the narrow panel and has nothing set there; that is a defect report, not a note.

### Reading the Component Tree
- `GET_ALL_ROOTS_INFO` — every page's {id, displayName}; start here.
- `FIND_COMPONENTS` — when the user names a component ("the submit button") rather than giving an id, resolve the name to its id here instead of descending the tree container by container. One call, whole client, every match tagged with the page it sits on.
- `GET_COMPONENT_INFO` — one component's type and config, by its component id.
- `GET_CONTAINER_CHILDREN_INFO` — the direct children of a container (or a special component's slot), by the container's id.
- `GET_COMPONENT_CONTEXT_INFO` — a component together with its ancestor chain and siblings, so you can see where it sits in the page.
Ids are opaque: copy them verbatim from these read tools and never modify them. A page id (from `GET_ALL_ROOTS_INFO`) is not a component id, and breakpoint keys (phone/tablet/desktop) are tool parameters, never part of an id — passing something like `<pageId>-desktop` as a component target fails with "target component not found".

### Building & Editing the Component Tree
Construction workflow:
1. `GET_ALL_ROOTS_INFO` / `GET_COMPONENT_CONTEXT_INFO` to locate where to build, and read the target container (writes are rejected until their targets have been read).
2. `GET_SELECTABLE_COMPONENT_TYPES` to pick types; `GET_COMPONENT_TEMPLATE` for a valid starter definition — always start from a template, never hand-write component JSON.
3. Edit the template (displayName, parentComponentId, inline children / slot definitions) and submit via `ADD_COMPONENT`. Ids are minted server-side and echoed back — use them directly instead of re-reading. Set the visible copy via content fields ('title'/'text' for BUTTON and TEXT, 'placeholder' for TEXT_INPUT); styles and remaining properties are seeded with the editor's creation defaults so components render visibly; nested children may omit parentComponentId.
4. Verify with `GET_CONTAINER_CHILDREN_INFO`.
Container sizing: a LAYOUT_VIEW hugs its content, so a container created WITH its children inside is sized by them and needs no height of its own; an empty one keeps a small minimum height so it stays visible and droppable, and filling it makes that minimum irrelevant. Give a container an explicit height only when you want a fixed-size box or a scroll viewport — a fixed height its content outgrows clips that content invisibly, and a fixed width crops text mid-word. `UPDATE_COMPONENT_STYLE` merges, so a size you do not name keeps its old value.
Width/height `fill` means "grow along the flex main axis", so it only makes sense on the axis the parent lays out along: `width: fill` in a row, `height: fill` in a column. On the other axis it would unset the size and let the child shrink to its content, so it is applied as '100%' instead and the result says so. There is no `stretch` alignment to fall back on — in Momen a component declares its own size rather than having its container negotiate one.
A row of cards is sized one axis at a time. Along the row, give every child `fill`, or fr shares — `65fr` and `35fr` — when the split is deliberate; never percentages, because fr divides what is left after the gap and the padding while `65%` + `35%` claims the whole width and the gap then pushes it over, wrapping or clipping the last column. Across the row, give every child the SAME `minHeight` so they bottom out together: a real `height` would clip the card whose content grows past it, and with no `stretch` to fall back on a shared floor is as close to equal-height cards as this system gets — a card whose content clears the floor still grows alone, so pick a floor that clears the tallest copy you expect. Set `minWidth` on a child only where that column has a genuine floor: it, not `flexWrap`, is what makes a row break into 2+1 once the container is narrower than the floors plus the gaps. Size the children this way and the container needs nothing beyond `flexDirection`, `gap` and its own width — `justifyContent` and `alignItems` have no free space left to distribute, so reaching for them to fix a ragged row means the children are the wrong size.
A TEXT holds a paragraph only because it is allowed to break: `textWrap` false pins it to one line and cuts it with an ellipsis at its box edge, however wide the sentence is. Anything longer than a label — body copy, a description, a card blurb — wants `textWrap: true`, and `lineClamp` on top of that when it must stop after N lines. When a sentence reports as clipped horizontally, this is nearly always why: widening the box, or setting `overflowX`, does not make the text reflow.
A TEXT_INPUT collecting a password needs `password: true` via `UPDATE_COMPONENT_PROPERTIES`; a "Password" placeholder alone does not mask anything.
Restructure with `MOVE_COMPONENTS` (reparent and/or reorder; the index is the position in the final children list). Restyle with `UPDATE_COMPONENT_STYLE` — merge-based: only the fields you provide change, everything else keeps its current value; flex settings (gap/direction/alignment) apply to containers only and text settings to BUTTON/TEXT/TEXT_INPUT only; target phone/tablet with the breakpoint param and the hover state with variant. Change scalar behavior properties (enums/booleans/numbers, e.g. list direction, input type) or rename a component with `UPDATE_COMPONENT_PROPERTIES` — binding-typed properties stay with the bindings tools. Remove with `DELETE_COMPONENTS` — it deletes each id's entire subtree, and references elsewhere (bindings, event targets, navigation) are NOT cleaned up automatically, so check them afterwards.

### Decide The Look Before You Place The First Component
A request that names no visual direction — "a task tracker", "a booking page" — is not a request for no styling. It is a request for you to decide, and declining to decide is what produces the grey-box build the user then has to describe their way out of. So decide first, in one line, before the first `ADD_COMPONENT` of a new project: what this app is, who opens it, the one job it does, and the palette and type roles that reading implies. A shift-handover tool for night-shift nurses and a portfolio for a ceramicist should not resolve to the same screen; the subject is where a non-generic direction comes from, and it is the only input you have that no other project shares. State that line to the user. A stated choice gets corrected; an accidental one gets discovered three screens later. Then set the palette (`ADD_COLOR_THEMES`) and the scale (`SET_STYLE_SCALE`) from that line, and build every screen out of them. A screen styled component-by-component, deciding each colour as it comes up, drifts by the third card — and the drift is what reads as unfinished, not any single value in it. The moment the user states a direction — a brand colour, "dark", "playful", a screenshot — it overrides all of this. What fails is splitting the difference: a stated direction on the first two screens and your own default on the rest reads worse than either applied throughout, because inconsistency looks like a bug rather than a choice.

### The Palette Is Named Before It Is Spent
A colour written as a hex is pinned to the component you wrote it on. A colour written as a palette reference follows the palette. Both render identically today, so the difference only shows up later — when the same surface colour has to be repeated by hand on the fifth page, or when one recolour turns into an edit per component. Call `GET_COLOR_THEMES` first: a project ships with only Background / Primary / Accent, which is not enough to build with. A working palette is roughly eight entries, named by ROLE, not by colour:
- Four neutrals, not two: the page ground, a surface lifted off it, a border a step darker again, and a hairline/divider weaker than the border. Two neutrals is the single most common cause of a flat screen — with only "background" and "border" available, every card, input, header and divider ends up drawn with the same one, and nothing separates from anything.
- Two inks: primary for content, muted for secondary text and labels. Do NOT make muted text by dropping `opacity` on a TEXT — opacity fades the whole component including anything it contains, and it composites against whatever is behind it, so the same "muted" reads differently on a card than on the page. Muted is a colour.
- One accent, and one status colour (danger) if the app writes data.
Spend the accent only on the primary action and the active/selected state. The moment it also appears on a heading, an icon and a border, nothing on the screen is being pointed at. Name entries by role rather than by colour — "surface", not "light-grey" — because that is what lets a later `UPDATE_COLOR_THEMES` restyle the whole app in one call. A literal hex belongs only on a one-off that genuinely should not move with the theme.

### The Scale, And The Two Things It Does Not Carry
Spacing, corners and type work through a scale rather than references: call `GET_STYLE_SCALE`, and if the project has none, set one with `SET_STYLE_SCALE` before the first screen — six or seven spacing steps, four or five radii, five or six named text roles (page title, section heading, body, label, caption), at most two font families. Values you send afterwards are pulled onto the nearest step and the result says when that happened; a value far from every step is left as sent, so a deliberate one-off — a pill radius, a hero size — still survives. This is not decoration: a build without a scale ends up with paddings of 12 and 14 and 18 and radii of 9 and 10 and 12, each defensible alone, and the result reads as unfinished even though every screen is individually reasonable. A text role carries `fontSize`, `fontWeight` and `lineHeight` — asking for a heading gets you the whole heading, not heading size at body weight. It does NOT carry `letterSpacing` or `fontFamily`. Those two exist only as per-component fields on `UPDATE_COMPONENT_STYLE`, so if you never send them, every text in the app is at the default tracking in the default face. That default is exactly what "looks like a wireframe" means, and it is two extra fields to fix.

### Typography Carries Most Of The Impression
The type is the largest coloured area on almost every screen, so it decides the character of the page before any accent does.
- Typeface is a real choice, but the platform's faces are a fixed set and nothing validates what you send against it: `fontFamily` on `UPDATE_COMPONENT_STYLE` takes any string and stores it verbatim, so a face the platform does not ship is not rejected and not substituted — it is simply stored, and the client renders a fallback. You will not be told. (If the project's scale already declares families, sending one outside them returns a note and still stores it; if the scale declares none, nothing is checked at all.) So pick from the faces that exist.
  The default is DM Sans, so leaving it alone is not neutral — it is the same face every other project ships with. Fifteen faces exist: the Latin workhorses DM Sans, Plus Jakarta Sans, Inter, Roboto and open sans; the system faces -apple-system, helvetica neue, tahoma and arial; Montserrat as a geometric display voice and D-DIN-PRO as a technical one; Yellowtail, a script for a single display line and nothing else; and for CJK only simsun, Smiley Sans and Vonwaon Bitmap.
  That last group is the real constraint: simsun is the only one of the three that can carry Chinese BODY text, while Smiley Sans and Vonwaon Bitmap are display faces. A Latin family carries no Chinese glyphs at all, so every Chinese character falls back to whatever the device has and the page you designed is not the page that renders.
  One family is a complete answer; two only when clearly distinct in role (a display face and a text face), never two sans faces that differ slightly. `GET_STYLE_SCALE` reports which ones this project already committed to — follow those rather than introducing a third.
- Hierarchy comes from weight and space as much as from size. Three text roles that differ only in `fontSize` read as one undifferentiated block; a heading at 600–700 against body at 400 separates at a glance even when the sizes are close.
- `letterSpacing` is in PIXELS, not em, and goes NEGATIVE on large display type — roughly -0.5px at a 28–32px page title, -1px or beyond as the size grows — because a face designed at body size is too loose when set large. Body text wants 0. A fractional value like -0.02 changes nothing visible, so sending one and then reporting the tracking as tightened is a false claim. It goes slightly POSITIVE only on small uppercase labels, which are themselves worth avoiding (see below).
- Set `maxWidth` on any TEXT holding a paragraph. Unbounded body text stretches to the container and a 1200px-wide line is unreadable regardless of how well it is styled; hold it near 60–70 characters, which at body size is roughly 600–680px. A capped column keeps hugging the left edge until its PARENT centres it — in a column parent (a PAGE's default) that is `alignItems: 'center'`. This is the most-skipped and most-visible typographic fix in a wide desktop layout.
- Body text needs `textWrap: true` — false pins it to one line and ellipsises it at the box edge however wide the sentence is. `lineClamp` on top when it must stop after N lines.

### Depth Is One Decision, Applied Once
`shadow` takes `{ offsetX, offsetY, blur, spread, color, inset }`, so it can do far more than a default drop shadow, and the failure mode is using it everywhere rather than using it well.
- A card lifts off the page with EITHER a hairline border OR a soft shadow, not both. Pick one for the whole app.
- A real shadow is large, soft and nearly transparent, and offset downward only — light comes from above. A tight dark shadow at every corner is the tell that nothing was decided; `blur` well above `offsetY`, and a colour at low alpha, is what reads as expensive.
- Elevation is a scale like everything else: at most two levels — resting surface, and the raised thing (modal, dropdown, the one hero card). A third level means the second is not doing its job.
- `inset: true` is for the pressed state of a button and for a well an input sits in. It is the only correct way to make something look recessed rather than raised.
- `backdropBlur` belongs on overlay chrome that sits over content — a sticky header, a modal scrim. On an ordinary card it costs paint and buys nothing, since there is nothing behind it to blur.
- `borderRadiusCorners` exists for the cases a single radius cannot express: a segmented control, a sheet rounded only at the top, a cell at the end of a row. Reach for it there and nowhere else.
- Radius is hierarchy. If the card, the input, the badge and the button all carry the same value, the screen has told the user nothing about what is what.

### Space Is The Cheapest Thing That Reads As Finished
The common failure is far too little of it, and it is not a matter of taste — the numbers are knowable. On desktop, section padding starts at 64px vertical and goes up, not down; card padding at 20–24px; the page gutter at least two spacing steps above the in-card gap, so a card reads as sitting on the page rather than pasted onto it. When a screen feels cramped, the fix is almost always more space AROUND the groups, not less space inside them. Proximity is the actual signal: things that belong together sit closer to each other than to anything else, and if a label is equidistant from its own field and the next one, the layout has lost the reader regardless of how the label is styled.

### The Look That Reads As Generated
None of these is forbidden — each is right for some brief — but they are what gets reached for when nothing has been decided, so they appear regardless of subject. Where the user asked for one, give it to them. Where they left the axis free, spend the freedom elsewhere:
- Cream page (near #F4F1EA) with a high-contrast serif display and a terracotta/clay accent (near #D97757).
- Near-black page with one acid-green or vermilion accent.
- Every surface on the same radius under the same soft grey shadow, whatever its role.
- A tracked-out ALL-CAPS eyebrow label above every heading.
- Meta strings joined with middle dots ('A · B · C'); '→' appended to button text.
- One word in a heading coloured or bolded to add interest.
- Numbered markers (01 / 02 / 03) on content that is not actually a sequence.
- A gradient used as decoration on a surface that has no reason to be gradient. A gradient is legitimate as the subject of a hero, or to keep text legible over an image; as a wash behind ordinary cards it is the clearest single tell.

### Every Interactive Thing Answers The Cursor
`UPDATE_COMPONENT_STYLE` takes `variant: 'hover'`, and a build that never sends it is a build where nothing on screen responds to the mouse. That, more than any colour choice, is what makes a page feel like a mockup rather than an application. Give every BUTTON, every clickable card and every list row a hover state — a surface a step lighter or darker is enough, and it costs one extra call per component type, not per component, because you are styling the same few shapes. Set `cursor: 'pointer'` on anything clickable that is not a BUTTON: a LAYOUT_VIEW with an ON_CLICK handler still shows an arrow cursor, so the user has no way to know it is a target. Where a SELECT_VIEW or a TAB_VIEW has a selected state, style it. The default selected state is not a design decision, and "the active tab looks like the inactive ones" is a bug the user will report in different words.

### Three Things Can Be Conditional — Pick The Smallest One
When a screen has two modes, do NOT reach for a conditional container first. Ask what actually differs between the modes, and make only that conditional:
- Conditional DATA (`CREATE_CONDITIONAL_BINDING`) when only VALUES differ — a label, a title, a placeholder, a colour. One component, one conditional binding whose branches are keyed off the deciding value. This is the default answer.
- Conditional ACTION when only BEHAVIOR differs — one button that submits, signs in or signs up depending on the mode. One button, one handler that branches.
- Conditional VIEW (CONDITIONAL_VIEW) only when the STRUCTURE differs — different fields, different counts of children. Branches do NOT share children, so anything you put in a branch is duplicated in every other branch. If the two modes share a form, keep the shared form OUTSIDE the CONDITIONAL_VIEW and put only the differing part inside it.
A "switchable signup / login" is therefore conditional data plus a conditional action over ONE shared form — not two branches each holding a copy of the same fields. Wrapping shared UI in branches is the classic wrong answer: it looks right and silently doubles the tree.
TAB_VIEW is a different question entirely: use it only when the tab strip itself is the affordance the user should see and click. It renders tab chrome you cannot remove.
Both TAB_VIEW and CONDITIONAL_VIEW take `preserveStateOnSwitch`, and it is the same mechanism in both: true keeps every case alive, so a scrolled list, a half-filled input or a loaded query survives switching away and back; false tears the inactive case down and rebuilds it from scratch. Both are created with it ON. Turn it off only when stale state would be wrong (a form that must reset), and remember the cost: every case stays mounted.

### Who Owns A CONDITIONAL_VIEW's Active Branch
Branch conditions and SWITCH_VIEW_CASE write the SAME runtime slot, so exactly one of them owns a given container — never both. A tool call that mixes them is rejected.
- Conditions own it (the default). The mode is app state: a page variable, a query result, a login state. Narrow each branch's condition at the conditionSchemaPath `ADD_COMPONENT` / `ADD_CONDITIONAL_VIEW_BRANCHES` echoes, and change the mode with SET_VARIABLE_DATA. Only this way does the right branch show on first render, react to data, and stay readable by everything else — a title, a colour, a query filter can all condition on the same variable.
- SWITCH_VIEW_CASE owns it only when the selection is purely visual, nothing outside the container will ever need to know which branch is active, and the first branch is the correct starting view — a carousel or an accordion. It never runs on page load and stores the choice where nothing can read it.
Left alone, branch conditions are always-true and the FIRST branch always shows. That is the state right after creation, so narrow them or switch to SWITCH_VIEW_CASE deliberately.

### Slots of Special Components
Slot children are mutated only with the slot tools:
- TAB_VIEW tabs: `ADD_TAB_VIEW_TABS` creates each tab's content container (a LAYOUT_VIEW child) plus its tabList entry, echoing the content child's id and the tab title binding's schemaPath. Tabs are addressed by their content-child id everywhere: `DELETE_TAB_VIEW_TABS` (a TAB_VIEW keeps at least 2 tabs) and `REORDER_TAB_VIEW_TABS` (pass a full permutation).
- CONDITIONAL_VIEW branches: `ADD_CONDITIONAL_VIEW_BRANCHES` inserts always-true branches — narrow each one with the bindings plugin's condition tools at the echoed conditionSchemaPath. Branch order IS evaluation order (first matching condition wins): `REORDER_CONDITIONAL_VIEW_BRANCHES`. The default case cannot be deleted (`DELETE_CONDITIONAL_VIEW_BRANCHES` takes non-default branches only) and always stays last.
- Optional slots: `SET_COMPONENT_SLOT` fills an empty LIST 'header'/'footer' or MAP 'marker' slot with a freshly created default child; `CLEAR_COMPONENT_SLOT` empties it again, deleting the subtree. Required slots (LIST 'cell', SELECT_VIEW states) are fixed at creation — to change one, recreate the component.
- SHEET columns: a SHEET does not take its data through a binding. `SET_SHEET_DATA_SOURCE` builds its embedded query from a table — call it immediately after creating the SHEET, because one without a data source is invalid — then add the displayed columns with `ADD_SHEET_COLUMNS`, managing them by data-field name with `DELETE_SHEET_COLUMNS` / `REORDER_SHEET_COLUMNS`. Filters and sorts go on the echoed querySchemaPath with the request tools.

### Components That Display a Field of Their Data
DATA_SELECTOR, SELECT_VIEW and LIST name one field of their data source: `displayDataField` (the value the user sees) and `cellKeyDataField` (the row identity). Binding the dataSource is not enough — a DATA_SELECTOR or SELECT_VIEW whose data source resolves to a list of objects is invalid until its displayDataField is set. Set it with `UPDATE_COMPONENT_PROPERTIES`, passing the field's plain NAME as a string; the full field reference is resolved for you, so never hand-assemble one. The candidates appear as selectableDataFields in `GET_COMPONENT_INFO` once the dataSource is bound — so the order is always: create → bind dataSource → read the component → name the field.

### Page Data: Queries, Variables & Inputs
Pages have NO separate query list — a page query IS a read-only page variable whose dataSource is a database query. It is for data more than one component reads, or a filter the page owns centrally; a single list showing one filtered table binds that table itself (see Data Bindings below) and needs nothing here:
- `ADD_COMPONENT_QUERY` attaches a table query to a PAGE or MODAL (limit 1 = single row, >1 = list). Components consume it through data bindings (bindings plugin) at the echoed dataSourceSchemaPath; narrow filters and sorting with the request-filter tools at that same path. The result also reports rolesWithoutSelect — grant SELECT with the permission plugin's table-permission tool; never assume it is granted automatically. Tune with `UPDATE_COMPONENT_QUERY`; remove queries and variables alike with `DELETE_COMPONENT_VARIABLES`.
- Page-local mutable state: `ADD_COMPONENT_VARIABLES`, with each typeIdentifier picked from `GET_COMPONENT_VARIABLE_SELECTABLE_TYPES` — never hand-assembled. A new variable starts with no value, so give it an initial one at the `defaultValueSchemaPath` the result echoes whenever anything reads it: conditional cases, branch conditions and SET_VARIABLE_DATA values all test the variable against specific values, and none of them match an empty variable. The page then loads with every dependent case unmatched — blank labels, the fallback branch showing — and a toggle whose new value is itself conditional on the old one cannot recover, because it has nothing to match either.
- Page parameters: `ADD_COMPONENT_INPUTS` / `UPDATE_COMPONENT_INPUT` / `DELETE_COMPONENT_INPUTS`. WEB pages take URL query/path params; WECHAT/MOBILE pages and MODALs take general inputs. Navigation and show-modal call sites pass one value per input.
- `SET_INITIAL_PAGE_ID` sets the app's home page for the current client.

### Data Bindings on Components
`GET_COMPONENT_BINDABLE_PROPERTIES` lists every place a component can be bound — always start there and copy the paths verbatim, never hand-assemble a binding path. It returns two sections: `properties`, the component's own slots, each with its ready-to-use schemaPath, expected type, current binding and scope; and `actionSlots`, the parameter slots of the actions already wired to its events, chained success/failure branches included. `ADD_COMPONENT_ACTIONS` echoes an action's slots when it creates it — bind them in the same turn when you can, and use `actionSlots` to find them again in any later turn. Fill the echoed paths with the bindings plugin's tools: `BROWSE_DATA_BINDING_OPTIONS` + `CREATE_OPTION_BINDING` for dataSource slots and other dynamic values, `CREATE_CONST_BINDING` for literals. A LIST, SELECT_VIEW or DATA_SELECTOR can take its dataSource either way, and the options tree offers both in one answer: the tables under 'Table', and any page query under 'Context > Current page > Data source'. **Prefer the table** — a component that owns its data source is filtered, sorted and retyped in one place, and `GET_REQUEST_FILTER_CONTEXT` narrows it at the component's own path. Reach for a page query (`ADD_COMPONENT_QUERY` first) only when the SAME result set is genuinely shared — two components reading one query, or a filter the page tunes centrally. One component, one filtered list is not a sharing case: adding a page variable there buys nothing and leaves a second thing to keep in step. Inside a list cell (scope "list-cell:<listId>") the options tree additionally offers the current list item's fields under 'item-data' — bind cell children to those instead of re-querying the table.

### Editing Protocol
- Read-before-edit: editing a component (or inserting into a container) you have not read fails with "has not been read" — read it first; after a conflict, re-read and retry. One read of a container covers both adding children to it and editing its own configuration, so `GET_COMPONENT_INFO` and `GET_CONTAINER_CHILDREN_INFO` on the same component is one call wasted.
- Everything you call in a single turn applies as one atomic batch: if any call in it fails, none of them landed, so fix the offending call and resend the whole group. Calls in *different* turns are independent — a failure there leaves earlier turns' work in place.
- Prefer one turn over many. Independent reads should always go together, and a read may sit in the same turn as an edit that depends on it. The one thing you cannot do is use an id or schema path echoed by a call in the same turn — those are only visible once the turn returns, so anything consuming them belongs in the next turn.
- Wiring behavior is always the same three steps: `GET_COMPONENT_SELECTABLE_EVENTS` for the events this component exposes, `GET_SELECTABLE_COMPONENT_ACTIONS` for the actions that event accepts here, then `ADD_COMPONENT_ACTIONS` to attach one. Never guess a kind — the selectable list is already filtered to this client's platform and the project's configuration, so anything absent from it cannot be attached and must be built in the editor instead. Remove any handler with `DELETE_COMPONENT_EVENT_HANDLERS`.
- Every action seeds its parameters as empty bindings and echoes them in bindableSchemaPaths; fill them with the bindings plugin's tools. Anything a specific kind returns beyond that arrives under that handler's `details`.
- Pick the kind from `GET_SELECTABLE_COMPONENT_ACTIONS` and take its parameter shape from this tool's parameter schema, which is the only complete list of the kinds and their fields — the editor offers far more than the handful named below, including SHOW_TOAST, OPEN_EXTERNAL_LINK, SET_CLIPBOARD, DOWNLOAD_FILE, CALL_PHONE, the payment kinds and the animation kinds. Do not conclude an interaction is impossible because it is not discussed here; the selectable list and the schema decide that. What follows is only the judgment the schema cannot carry.
- ALERT_DIALOG is the runtime's own confirm box — a title, a message and two buttons it draws itself, with no MODAL to build or lay out. Use it for "are you sure?"; use SHOW_MODAL when the dialog needs your own components in it. Chain what confirming does onto ALERT_DIALOG's ON_CONFIRM branch, or the buttons do nothing.
- Building a MODAL does not make it reachable. Without a SHOW_MODAL action pointing at it, nothing opens it, and the modal you just laid out is dead UI the user cannot reach.
- An action that produces a RESULT — GET_LOCATION, UPLOAD_FILE, GENERATE_QR_CODE and the other result-bearing kinds — can only keep it through assignToVariable, a writable page variable created with `ADD_COMPONENT_VARIABLES` on the page the component sits on. Their success branches cannot see the result, so an action without assignToVariable runs and throws its answer away. Create the variable first.
- SIGN_UP and USER_LOGIN are separate actions, and the password slot on a SIGN_UP decides what the account can sign in with later: leave it unbound and the account has no password, so a USER_LOGIN with credentialType PASSWORD can never succeed for anyone who signed up there. Build the pair together, or sign in with VERIFICATION_CODE.
- A WeChat mini-program signs its user in by itself. The client is created with a silent WeChat login in its own app-did-load configuration, which the editor will not let anyone delete, so whoever opens the app is already signed in, and the account is created there too. Do NOT build a sign-in or sign-up screen there and do NOT wire a login action: USER_LOGIN offers no WeChat mode at all, the silent login belongs to that configuration alone, and SIGN_IN / SIGN_UP / SIGN_OUT are absent from the mini-program's selectable actions. When the app needs the user's phone number, use OBTAIN_PHONE_NUMBER.
- MUTATION writes the database without an action flow. rolesWithoutPermission in its result is report-only — grant the table permission with the permission plugin or the write is denied at runtime, which looks like a silent no-op to the user. rowScope CURRENT_ITEM is valid only inside a LIST cell; refreshOnSuccess is preferable to a separate REFRESH.
- SCHEDULED_JOB_CONTROL starts or pauses a page timer, but NO tool creates the job — those are made in the editor's page Action panel. If the page has none, say so and ask the user to add it rather than trying to build one.
- CONDITIONAL is how ONE event does different things in different cases: branches in evaluation order, first match wins, each branch narrowed at the echoed conditionSchemaPath and filled by a further `ADD_COMPONENT_ACTIONS` carrying that branch's conditionalBranchId. Leave the last branch always-true as the else. Without it every action on the event fires on every click — onSuccess / onFailure branch on whether a call worked, never on a data condition. Do NOT reach for an action flow to get branching: a flow's BRANCH node runs on the server and cannot navigate, toast or open a modal, so frontend branching belongs here. This decides what HAPPENS; a CONDITIONAL_VIEW decides what is DISPLAYED.
- There is no per-component conditional visibility — an ordinary component has no data-driven show/hide flag. To make content appear only when a condition holds, wrap it in a CONDITIONAL_VIEW container and gate the branch with the bindings plugin's condition tools (see CONDITIONAL_VIEW branches under "Slots of Special Components").

### Motion Is One Moment, Not A Coat Of Paint
Momen has animation as ACTIONS, not style fields, so they are attached with `ADD_COMPONENT_ACTIONS` like any other handler: ANIMATION_FADE_EFFECT and ANIMATION_SLIDE_EFFECT (APPEAR / DISAPPEAR, eight directions, a distance defaulting to 150px), ANIMATION_SCALE_EFFECT, ANIMATION_COMMON_EMPHASIS (BOUNCE / PULSE / BLINK), ANIMATION_FLIP_EMPHASIS, and ANIMATION_SCROLLING_INTERACTION. Each takes delay, and the emphasis kinds take repeat or loop.
The rules are hard ones, and breaking them shows up as a project error rather than a subtle defect: exactly ONE animation per event, and only on onClick, onHover or onScrollIntoPage — the runtime reads the last effect it finds on the event and ignores any attached elsewhere. ANIMATION_SCROLLING_INTERACTION is the exception and goes ONLY on onPageScroll, which carries nothing else at all, because the curve is driven by scroll distance. None of them take attachTo and none take bindings, so they cannot be chained onto a success branch.
Spend motion the way you spend the accent. Movement that answers what a person just did — a press, an open, a confirm — is worth it, because it shows what changed. Movement that merely announces that content exists is the generated-page tell: a fade-and-slide on every section as it scrolls into view reads as a template, and it reads that way precisely because it is the first thing reached for. One orchestrated moment on the screen that matters beats an effect on every card, and a screen with no animation at all is a perfectly good answer — far better than one where everything twitches. The emphasis kinds earn their place on something genuinely needing attention, never as decoration, and BLINK almost never earns it.

### Reviewing The Screen You Built
Make ALL edits first, then run `schema validate` and resolve anything your changes introduced. The editor's error center and canvas screenshots are not reachable from here, so you cannot confirm a result visually — ask the user to open the screen in the editor and read it against the following, then fix what they report:
1. Is there one clear focal point, or is everything competing at the same weight?
2. Do related things sit closer together than unrelated things?
3. Are there at least three distinguishable levels of text, and do they differ in weight and not only in size?
4. Does anything touch an edge that should have gutter, or run to a line length past ~70 characters?
5. Does the accent appear only on the primary action and the active state, or has it leaked onto headings and borders?
6. Does anything on the screen respond to hover?
Name what you are fixing and fix it. A screen that passes `schema validate` and fails all six is not done — validation only knows about invalid schema, and none of the above is invalid. Report only what you actually changed. Every claim about appearance — a heading looks larger, a selected state looks different, spacing was tightened — must correspond to an `UPDATE_COMPONENT_STYLE` (or creation-time style) call you made in this session. If a requested look was not achievable with the available tools, say which part you skipped and why; do not describe the component's built-in default styling as if you had applied it. A user who is told the work is done stops checking.

## How to drive it (CLI only)

All commands are `npx -y momen-mcp@2.7.8 <verb>`. A long-lived daemon holds the in-memory CRDT schema session
between calls. **Edits do NOT go live until `project sync-backend`.**

```bash
npx -y momen-mcp@2.7.8 whoami                                    # check auth; if needed: npx -y momen-mcp@2.7.8 login
# create a NEW project (auto-pins it; its pre/post type-system state follows the account rollout):
npx -y momen-mcp@2.7.8 project create --projectName "My App"
# …or pin an EXISTING one (find its exId with npx -y momen-mcp@2.7.8 projects search):
npx -y momen-mcp@2.7.8 project set-current --projectExId <exId>
npx -y momen-mcp@2.7.8 schema load                               # warm the schema session
```

Operations run through one verb:

```bash
npx -y momen-mcp@2.7.8 schema tool-call --toolCalls '[{"name":"<TOOL_NAME>","args":{ ... }}]'
```
Each call is applied immediately — any resulting CRDT patch is uploaded. Batch several calls in one array; use `schema undo` to revert the last change.
A batch is all-or-nothing: when any call in the array fails, the whole batch's changes are discarded even though the other calls returned success — only the failing call's error is reported, so after a batch error re-read (`GET_*`) before assuming anything persisted.

## Operation reference (`schema tool-call` names)

| Intent | `name` | Required `args` |
|---|---|---|
| List pages and modals | `GET_ALL_ROOTS_INFO` | — |
| Component info | `GET_COMPONENT_INFO` | `componentId` or `schemaPath` |
| Style keys a component type accepts | `GET_COMPONENT_TYPE_CAPABILITIES` | `componentTypes` |
| Data/vars in scope at a component | `GET_COMPONENT_CONTEXT_INFO` | `componentId` |
| Types a page variable or page input accepts | `GET_COMPONENT_VARIABLE_SELECTABLE_TYPES` | — |
| Container children info | `GET_CONTAINER_CHILDREN_INFO` | `componentId` |
| Switch a TAB_VIEW between built-in and custom tabs | `SET_TAB_VIEW_TAB_MODE` | `componentId`, `mode` |
| Native tab bar: state, colours, slots | `GET_TAB_BAR_INFO` | — |
| Show or hide the native tab bar | `SET_TAB_BAR_ENABLED` | `enabled` |
| Point a tab-bar slot at a page | `UPDATE_TAB_BAR_ITEMS` | `items` |
| Colour the tab bar | `UPDATE_TAB_BAR_STYLE` | — |
| Duplicate components with their subtrees | `DUPLICATE_COMPONENTS` | `componentIds` |
| Append one event's action handlers to another | `DUPLICATE_COMPONENT_ACTIONS` | `componentId`, `eventType`, `sourceComponentId` |
| Remove colour-palette entries | `DELETE_COLOR_THEMES` | `items` |

Component writes go through the CLI like any other edit: `GET_COMPONENT_TEMPLATE` then `ADD_COMPONENT` to build, `UPDATE_COMPONENT_STYLE` to restyle, `MOVE_COMPONENTS` to restructure, `ADD_COMPONENT_ACTIONS` to wire events, `DELETE_COMPONENTS` to remove — see "Building & Editing the Component Tree" above. Two limits are real. A project still on the legacy component model rejects every component write with `TRACK_MISMATCH` and says so; when that happens, give the user numbered editor steps instead. And you cannot see what you built — the editor canvas and error center are not reachable from here, so a screen can be schema-valid and still look wrong. Verify structurally with `GET_CONTAINER_CHILDREN_INFO` and `GET_INCOMPLETE_STRUCTURES` (its `responsiveRisks` catches the desktop-width-on-phone case), and where appearance is the acceptance criterion, prefer handing the user steps over guessing.

The preset tab-bar icon library is reachable: `npx -y momen-mcp@2.7.8 component tab-bar-icons` lists every icon this deployment ships as a name and the media exId `UPDATE_TAB_BAR_ITEMS` takes. A shown tab needs an icon for both its normal and its selected state or the project reports an error, and the exIds are hashids of media rows that cannot be derived from an icon's name — a value that could not be an exId is refused by the write rather than failing the mini-program build over a file it cannot find, so take them from that listing and never invent one. An icon the library does not ship still has to be brought in through the editor (`web-assets.md`) or picked there by the user: nothing here imports media.

Then ship:

```bash
npx -y momen-mcp@2.7.8 schema validate && npx -y momen-mcp@2.7.8 project sync-backend
```
`project sync-backend` aborts with `SAVE_SCHEMA_WITHOUT_PATCHES` when nothing is pending — make at least one change before shipping.
