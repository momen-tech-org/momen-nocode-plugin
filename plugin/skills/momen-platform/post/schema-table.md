# Database schema (tables, fields, relations, constraints)

## Database Domain Knowledge
Momen uses PostgreSQL. Data model changes require "Sync Backend" to take effect online.

### Capabilities & Limitations
You can: create and delete tables, fields, relations, and unique constraints; change a table's displayName / description; change a field's displayName / required / default value; create formula (computed) fields.
Tables and fields are addressed by their displayName in every tool on this plugin.
(Enums are created and edited via the 'type' plugin.)
You CANNOT:
- Rename a table or a field. An apiName is fixed when the entity is created — only its displayName can change afterwards. If an apiName is genuinely wrong, delete and recreate it; recreating a field discards the data already stored in it. Choose apiNames carefully up front.
- Change an existing column's TYPE, or its uniqueness. To change either, delete the column and create a new one; uniqueness cannot be added later because existing rows may already hold duplicates.
- Update an existing relation or constraint. To change one, delete it and recreate it.

### Every table edit rewrites role permissions
Creating or deleting a table, and adding, retyping or deleting a field, rewrites the role permissions keyed to that table. Nobody asks for it, and a new table lands in every role including Anonymous User, so the grants you end up with are not the ones you chose. Each of those results names the roles it changed. Before changing one of them, read that role with GET_ROLE_DETAIL: a permission write is rejected until the role has been read in this session, and the role you would reach for is one your own table edit just moved.

### Column Types
A new field's 'typeIdentifier' is copied verbatim from GET_TABLE_FIELD_SELECTABLE_TYPES, which lists every type a field on this project accepts. Its vocabulary is the wrapped identifier: s:p:string, s:p:decimal, s:p:bigint, s:p:boolean, s:p:timestamptz, s:p:timetz, s:p:date, s:p:jsonb, s:p:image, s:p:video, s:p:file, s:p:geo_point, s:p:timezone for the primitives, and "u:e:<enumId>" for an enum.

Never assemble one by hand, and never pass a bare name or a bare enum id — "decimal" and
"mja44si4" are not field types here; "s:p:decimal" and "u:e:mja44si4" are. An enum the
picker does not list does not exist yet: create it with the 'type' plugin (same turn,
before the column), then call GET_TABLE_FIELD_SELECTABLE_TYPES again and copy what it returns. The
separate 'required' field controls nullability; never wrap a type in a null union.

Read results report a field's existing type using legacy uppercase names (TEXT, BIGINT).
That is the read vocabulary only — when creating a field, still pass the picker's
identifier (e.g. a column shown as TEXT is created with "s:p:string").

### Formula (Computed) Fields
A computed field's value is derived from the row's other fields every time it is read, so it never goes stale. Create one by passing `computed: true` on the field — it takes no default, cannot be required, and cannot be an image / video / file / JSON type. The field is created with an EMPTY formula, which is a project error until you fill it, so finish it in the same turn:
1. Take the field's `formulaSchemaPath` from the create result (GET_TABLES_INFO reports it for fields created earlier, under `formulaFields`).
2. Load the 'bindings' plugin and build the formula at that path — `bindings.get_formula_operators` then `bindings.create_formula_binding`, filling each operand at the paths that result echoes.

Never fake a computed field with a plain column written at insert time: it goes stale the moment any input changes. Reach for a write-time value only when the user wants the number frozen as of the write.

### Naming
apiName — spelled 'tableApiName' on a table, 'apiName' on a field, 'fieldApiNameInSourceTable' / 'fieldApiNameInTargetTable' on the two sides of a relation, and reported under those names by every read: English snake_case. Tables are nouns or noun phrases, singular not plural ("order", not "orders"), concise (e.g. "user_profile"); fields are snake_case (e.g. "first_name", "is_active"). No name may contain a space — not tables, fields, relations, or constraints, and not even the displayName. An apiName is permanent once created; only the displayName can be changed later. displayName: user-visible; prefer it IDENTICAL to the apiName (e.g. apiName "first_name" → displayName "first_name").

### System Built-ins & Product Context
Every table has non-deletable built-in fields: id (s:p:bigint), created_at (s:p:timestamptz), updated_at (s:p:timestamptz). Do NOT include these when creating a table. Any table, field, or relation where 'editable' is false is system built-in and cannot be modified or deleted. System tables and timezone configurations for Momen:
* UTC Offset: +00:00
* Protected Account Table: 'account' (can add/delete user-defined fields, but cannot delete table itself)
* Protected Payment Tables: 'payment_record', 'recurring_payment', 'refund' (cannot be modified or deleted)
* Protected AI/Session Tables: 'conversation', 'message', 'tool_usage_record', 'message_content' (cannot be modified or deleted) The system built-in AI tables are strictly for system AI functions. For user chat systems, always create custom user-defined tables (e.g. 'user_chat', 'chat_message').

### Required Fields & Default Values
A field declared inside ADD_TABLES needs no default value, whatever its 'required' setting: the table is created empty, so a mandatory column has no existing rows to satisfy. Everywhere else a 'required' field needs one — ADD_FIELDS_AND_RELATIONS adding it, or UPDATE_FIELDS_AND_RELATIONS turning 'required' on for an existing field — and both are rejected without one. This holds even for a table you created earlier in this conversation: only ADD_TABLES can tell that the table holds no rows, so declare the mandatory fields there.
Default value formatting:
- s:p:bigint, s:p:decimal, and s:p:boolean: Use literal values (e.g., 10, true).
- s:p:timestamptz, s:p:date, and s:p:timetz: Strictly use ISO 8601 strings (e.g., '2025-12-09T16:02:03.000Z', '2025-12-09', '16:02:03+00:00').
- u:e:<enumId>: Use the option's id, i.e. its FULL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE value (e.g., 'PENDING').
- s:p:string: Use plain strings.
- s:p:jsonb: Use stringified JSON objects.
- Unsupported: s:p:image, s:p:video, s:p:file, and s:p:geo_point do not support default values.

### Relations
Types: one_to_one, one_to_many. Defined on the source table.
To make one table reference another, create a RELATION — never add a manual foreign-key column (e.g. a "*_id" field) or a column whose type is another table. The FK column and the virtual reference fields are generated automatically. Add the relation on the SOURCE table only; it is reflected on the target automatically.
A relation is configured by seven required fields: relationType, sourceTableDisplayName, targetTableDisplayName, and both a display name and an apiName for the field it adds to each side — fieldDisplayNameInSourceTable / fieldApiNameInSourceTable and fieldDisplayNameInTargetTable / fieldApiNameInTargetTable. Reads report those seven plus 'editable'. Each of those four names a field that does not exist yet, so each must be unique among its own table's fields, relations on that table included: reusing a column name ("id"), the table's own name, or another relation's field name on that table is rejected.
Creating a relation auto-generates:
- A non-editable FK field in the target table, its display name fieldDisplayNameInTargetTable + "_id" (e.g. "user_id", "活动_id") and its apiName fieldApiNameInTargetTable + "_id". Stores the source row's id, and is unique when the relation is one_to_one. Never write that "_id" yourself: "user_id" as the target-side name produces the field "user_id_id". Deleted when the relation is deleted.
- Virtual reference fields in both tables (NOT real columns), one per side: fieldDisplayNameInSourceTable lives on the source; fieldDisplayNameInTargetTable lives on the target.
Examples:
- 1:n user (source) → post (target), source field "posts", target field "user"
⇒ user has virtual list "posts"; post has virtual reference "user" and FK column "user_id".
- 1:n post (source) → comment (target), source field "comments", target field "post"
⇒ post has virtual list "comments"; comment has virtual reference "post" and FK column "post_id".
- 1:1 user (source) → profile (target), source field "profile", target field "user"
⇒ user has virtual reference "profile"; profile has virtual reference "user" and FK column "user_id".
Relations only between editable (user-created) tables.
Many-to-many: use an intermediate join table + two one-to-many relations.
To unique-constrain a relation field, use the FK field name ("user_id"), not the virtual name.

### Enums (managed by the 'type' plugin)
Enum types are created and edited via the 'type' plugin, not here. To use an enum as a column type, use "u:e:<enumId>" with the actual id from type.list_enums. Create the enum first via the 'type' plugin (same turn, before the column) if it does not yet exist — you supply the id there, so you can reference it immediately.

### Geographic Location
Use s:p:geo_point for coordinates. Never split into separate latitude/longitude fields. A s:p:geo_point field auto-generates a companion s:p:decimal hack field named "fz_distance_from_<apiName>", where <apiName> is the geo_point's apiName (may differ from its displayName). At request time it returns the distance from the stored geo_point to the user-supplied location in the request. Treat it as a distance-calculation hack — future migration: this will be replaced by formula fields.

### Constraints
Only unique constraints supported. Constraint name: lowercase English snake_case, no uppercase. Reference fields by their displayName — for a relation's foreign key use the generated FK field ("user_id"). Uniqueness is fixed when a field is created and cannot be turned on afterwards (existing rows could already hold duplicates), so to make an existing field unique, add a constraint over it. Use a constraint to span multiple fields (composite unique): list the fields' displayNames. Unique constraints are also the only DB-enforced invariant writers can lean on for atomic insert-if-absent / toggle semantics (insert with on_conflict): whenever the design has "at most one row per X" semantics (a join/like/save table, an idempotency key), create the unique constraint up front — read-check-then-insert cannot be made race-safe without it.

A relation's generated FK carries two names, and which one a call wants depends on the call. The schema tools here take displayNames, so a relation named 转译行 gives a FK whose displayName is `转译行_id` — that is what ADD_CONSTRAINTS matches on. The runtime API takes apiNames, so the same column is `translation_row_id` in a `runtime.query` filter or a `runtime.insert` object. Neither side accepts the other's name, and passing the wrong one reports the field as missing rather than as misnamed. Read both off the field record instead of transliterating one into the other.

## How to drive it (CLI only)

All commands are `npx -y momen-mcp@2.7.8 <verb>`. A long-lived daemon holds the in-memory CRDT schema session
between calls. **Edits do NOT go live until `project sync-backend`.**

```bash
npx -y momen-mcp@2.7.8 whoami                                    # check auth; if needed: npx -y momen-mcp@2.7.8 login
# create a NEW project (auto-pins it; its pre/post type-system state follows the account rollout):
npx -y momen-mcp@2.7.8 project create --projectName "My App"
# …or pin an EXISTING one (find its exId with npx -y momen-mcp@2.7.8 projects search):
npx -y momen-mcp@2.7.8 project set-current --projectExId <exId>
npx -y momen-mcp@2.7.8 schema load                               # warm the schema session
```

Operations run through one verb:

```bash
npx -y momen-mcp@2.7.8 schema tool-call --toolCalls '[{"name":"<TOOL_NAME>","args":{ ... }}]'
```
Each call is applied immediately — any resulting CRDT patch is uploaded. Batch several calls in one array; use `schema undo` to revert the last change.
A batch is all-or-nothing: when any call in the array fails, the whole batch's changes are discarded even though the other calls returned success — only the failing call's error is reported, so after a batch error re-read (`GET_*`) before assuming anything persisted.

## Worked example: create a `post` table

Read the field-type picker first, then copy its `typeIdentifier` values verbatim:

```bash
npx -y momen-mcp@2.7.8 schema tool-call --toolCalls '[{"name":"GET_TABLE_FIELD_SELECTABLE_TYPES","args":{}}]'
npx -y momen-mcp@2.7.8 schema tool-call --toolCalls '[
  {"name":"ADD_TABLES","args":{"items":[
    {"tableDisplayName":"post","tableApiName":"post","relations":[],"fields":[
      {"apiName":"title","displayName":"title","typeIdentifier":"s:p:string","required":true,"defaultValue":""},
      {"apiName":"view_count","displayName":"view_count","typeIdentifier":"s:p:bigint","required":true,"defaultValue":0}
    ]}
  ]}}
]'
```

A BM25 index exists to be ordered by: declaring one on a TEXT field mints a `<field>_bm25` order-by field on the project GraphQL API, which is what ranks rows for a keyword search at runtime (`baas-database.md`). Only TEXT fields are indexable, a field carries at most one index per type, and the declaration is refused if a column already holds the `<field>_bm25` name. The parameters are frozen once it exists — retuning `k1`, `b`, or `textConfig` means `DELETE_DATABASE_INDEX` and declaring it again — and deleting the field drops its indexes with it. `GET_TABLES_INFO` reports what a table already carries. Vector search below is the other half: BM25 ranks the words that are there, embeddings match meaning.

## Arguments (generated from ztype)

Shapes and field docs below are generated from ztype's `tool-schemas.json` (the source of truth) — never hand-built. `schemaPath` is a `DiffPathComponents` array (`{key}` for an object step, `{index}` for an array step) and is always read back from a discovery call (see above), never fabricated.

### `ADD_TABLES`

Create tables, each with a displayName and its initial fields.
- `items` *(required)*: `array<{fields: array<{apiName: string, computed?: boolean, defaultValue?: boolean | string | number | object, displayName: string, required: boolean, typeIdentifier?: string}>, relations?: array<{fieldApiNameInSourceTable: string, fieldApiNameInTargetTable: string, fieldDisplayNameInSourceTable: string, fieldDisplayNameInTargetTable: string, relationType: string, sourceTableDisplayName: string, targetTableDisplayName: string}>, tableApiName: string, tableDisplayName: string}>`
  - `items[].fields[].apiName` — English snake_case
  - `items[].fields[].computed` — Makes this a computed (formula) field: its value comes from a formula instead of being stored. The field is created with an empty formula — configure it afterwards with GET_FORMULA_OPERATORS + CREATE_FORMULA_BINDING at its `formulaSchemaPath`, which ADD_FIELDS_AND_RELATIONS echoes and GET_TABLES_INFO reports. A computed field cannot be required and takes no default value, and its type cannot be an image / video / file / JSON one.
  - `items[].fields[].defaultValue` — Default value, in the field's own type. A scalar for a scalar field: an enum field takes one of its option ids, a JSONB field a valid JSON document, a date field a 'YYYY-MM-DD' string, a time field an 'HH:mm:ssZ' string (e.g. '09:30:00+08:00'), a date-time field an ISO 8601 instant (e.g. '2027-01-31T09:30:00.000Z'). An object for the two types no scalar can carry: a geo-point field takes {"longitude": <-180..180>, "latitude": <-90..90>}, an image / video / file field takes {"exId": "<uploaded resource id>"}. A field of a legacy-type-system project takes no default value at all.
  - `items[].fields[].required` — Whether a value is mandatory. A mandatory field added to a table that is already there also needs a `defaultValue`: making it mandatory adds a NOT NULL check the rows the table already holds have to satisfy. A field of a table ADD_TABLES is creating in this same call needs none — that table starts empty.
  - `items[].fields[].typeIdentifier` — Required. The field's type, copied verbatim from GET_TABLE_FIELD_SELECTABLE_TYPES — never assemble it by hand. Pass the concrete type; `required` decides whether the stored type is optional.
  - `items[].relations[].fieldApiNameInSourceTable` — English snake_case spelling of `fieldDisplayNameInSourceTable`: 'posts', 'profile'. Unique among the source table's field API names -- a column name such as 'id', or the source table's own name, collides with what that table already has.
  - `items[].relations[].fieldApiNameInTargetTable` — English snake_case spelling of `fieldDisplayNameInTargetTable`: 'author', 'user'. Unique among the target table's field API names, and without an '_id' suffix -- 'author_id' here stores a foreign-key column named 'author_id_id'.
  - `items[].relations[].fieldDisplayNameInSourceTable` — Name of the new field the relation adds to the source table, holding what it points at: the list of target rows for a one-to-many relation ('posts' on the author table), the single target row for a one-to-one one ('profile' on the user table). This names a field that does not exist yet, never a field either table already has: it has to be unique among the source table's own fields, relations included.
  - `items[].relations[].fieldDisplayNameInTargetTable` — Name of the new field the relation adds to the target table, holding the single source row it belongs to, whichever the relation type: 'author' on the post table, 'user' on the profile table. Name it after what it points at ('author'), not after a column ('author_id') -- the generated foreign-key field is this name plus an '_id' suffix of its own. Unique among the target table's own fields, relations included.
  - `items[].relations[].relationType` — Enum: ['one_to_one', 'one_to_many']
  - `items[].relations[].sourceTableDisplayName` — Table the relation is declared on and points from: the 'one' side of a one-to-many relation (the author table of author-has-many-posts), or either side of a one-to-one relation (the user table of user-has-one-profile).
  - `items[].relations[].targetTableDisplayName` — Table the relation points to: the 'many' side of a one-to-many relation (the post table of author-has-many-posts), or the other side of a one-to-one relation (the profile table of user-has-one-profile). Either way this is the table that gets the generated foreign-key field, which a one-to-one relation additionally makes unique.
  - `items[].tableApiName` — English snake_case translation of tableDisplayName, singular for the same reason — "order", not "orders".
  - `items[].tableDisplayName` — Display name of the table. A table names one record, so use the SINGULAR noun — "order", not "orders"; "order_item", not "order_items".

### `ADD_FIELDS_AND_RELATIONS`

Add fields and relations to one table, addressed by displayName. Each field's `typeIdentifier` comes verbatim from GET_TABLE_FIELD_SELECTABLE_TYPES — never assemble one by hand. Relations go in the `relations` argument, declared on the SOURCE table; the target side and its foreign-key field are generated automatically, so never add a manual foreign-key field instead. Send whichever of the two lists the change needs; omit the other.
- `fields`: `array<{apiName: string, computed?: boolean, defaultValue?: boolean | string | number | object, displayName: string, required: boolean, typeIdentifier?: string}>`
  - `fields[].apiName` — English snake_case
  - `fields[].computed` — Makes this a computed (formula) field: its value comes from a formula instead of being stored. The field is created with an empty formula — configure it afterwards with GET_FORMULA_OPERATORS + CREATE_FORMULA_BINDING at its `formulaSchemaPath`, which ADD_FIELDS_AND_RELATIONS echoes and GET_TABLES_INFO reports. A computed field cannot be required and takes no default value, and its type cannot be an image / video / file / JSON one.
  - `fields[].defaultValue` — Default value, in the field's own type. A scalar for a scalar field: an enum field takes one of its option ids, a JSONB field a valid JSON document, a date field a 'YYYY-MM-DD' string, a time field an 'HH:mm:ssZ' string (e.g. '09:30:00+08:00'), a date-time field an ISO 8601 instant (e.g. '2027-01-31T09:30:00.000Z'). An object for the two types no scalar can carry: a geo-point field takes {"longitude": <-180..180>, "latitude": <-90..90>}, an image / video / file field takes {"exId": "<uploaded resource id>"}. A field of a legacy-type-system project takes no default value at all.
  - `fields[].required` — Whether a value is mandatory. A mandatory field added to a table that is already there also needs a `defaultValue`: making it mandatory adds a NOT NULL check the rows the table already holds have to satisfy. A field of a table ADD_TABLES is creating in this same call needs none — that table starts empty.
  - `fields[].typeIdentifier` — Required. The field's type, copied verbatim from GET_TABLE_FIELD_SELECTABLE_TYPES — never assemble it by hand. Pass the concrete type; `required` decides whether the stored type is optional.
- `relations`: `array<{fieldApiNameInSourceTable: string, fieldApiNameInTargetTable: string, fieldDisplayNameInSourceTable: string, fieldDisplayNameInTargetTable: string, relationType: string, sourceTableDisplayName: string, targetTableDisplayName: string}>`
  - `relations[].fieldApiNameInSourceTable` — English snake_case spelling of `fieldDisplayNameInSourceTable`: 'posts', 'profile'. Unique among the source table's field API names -- a column name such as 'id', or the source table's own name, collides with what that table already has.
  - `relations[].fieldApiNameInTargetTable` — English snake_case spelling of `fieldDisplayNameInTargetTable`: 'author', 'user'. Unique among the target table's field API names, and without an '_id' suffix -- 'author_id' here stores a foreign-key column named 'author_id_id'.
  - `relations[].fieldDisplayNameInSourceTable` — Name of the new field the relation adds to the source table, holding what it points at: the list of target rows for a one-to-many relation ('posts' on the author table), the single target row for a one-to-one one ('profile' on the user table). This names a field that does not exist yet, never a field either table already has: it has to be unique among the source table's own fields, relations included.
  - `relations[].fieldDisplayNameInTargetTable` — Name of the new field the relation adds to the target table, holding the single source row it belongs to, whichever the relation type: 'author' on the post table, 'user' on the profile table. Name it after what it points at ('author'), not after a column ('author_id') -- the generated foreign-key field is this name plus an '_id' suffix of its own. Unique among the target table's own fields, relations included.
  - `relations[].relationType` — Enum: ['one_to_one', 'one_to_many']
  - `relations[].sourceTableDisplayName` — Table the relation is declared on and points from: the 'one' side of a one-to-many relation (the author table of author-has-many-posts), or either side of a one-to-one relation (the user table of user-has-one-profile).
  - `relations[].targetTableDisplayName` — Table the relation points to: the 'many' side of a one-to-many relation (the post table of author-has-many-posts), or the other side of a one-to-one relation (the profile table of user-has-one-profile). Either way this is the table that gets the generated foreign-key field, which a one-to-one relation additionally makes unique.
- `tableDisplayName` *(required)*: `string`

### `DELETE_FIELDS_AND_RELATIONS`

Delete fields and relations from one table by displayName — fields in `fieldDisplayNames`, relations in `relationFieldDisplayNamesInSourceTable`. Send whichever list the change needs and omit the other. Data stored in a deleted field is lost, and a deleted relation takes the generated foreign-key field on the target table with it.
- `fieldDisplayNames`: `array<string>` — Display names of the fields to delete
- `relationFieldDisplayNamesInSourceTable`: `array<string>` — fieldDisplayNameInSourceTable of the relations to delete
- `tableDisplayName` *(required)*: `string` — Source table display name

### `ADD_CONSTRAINTS`

Add unique constraints to a table, spanning one or more of its fields. Use this for composite uniqueness.
- `constraints` *(required)*: `array<{constraintName: string, constraintType: string, fieldDisplayNames: array<string>, tableDisplayName: string}>`
  - `constraints[].constraintName` — snake_case, e.g. 'unique_user_email'
  - `constraints[].constraintType` — Enum: ['UNIQUE']

### `DELETE_CONSTRAINTS`

Remove unique constraints from a table by constraint name.
- `constraints` *(required)*: `array<{constraintName: string, tableDisplayName: string}>`

### `ADD_DATABASE_INDEX`
- `b`: `number` — BM25 length normalization, 0.0-1.0; engine default 0.75.
- `fieldDisplayName` *(required)*: `string` — Display name of the field to build the index on.
- `indexType` *(required)*: `enum(BM25)` — BM25 ranks a TEXT field by keyword relevance, queryable through the <field>_bm25 order-by field of the project GraphQL API.
- `k1`: `number` — BM25 term-frequency saturation, 0.1-10.0; engine default 1.2.
- `tableDisplayName` *(required)*: `string`
- `textConfig` *(required)*: `enum(SIMPLE|ENGLISH|CHINESE)` — How the field's text is split into searchable terms. SIMPLE lowercases and splits on non-word characters with no stemming or stop-word removal — the safe pick for codes, identifiers, names, and mixed or unknown languages. ENGLISH adds English stemming and stop words, so 'running' matches 'run'. CHINESE segments with zhparser, which has no whitespace word boundaries to rely on.

### `DELETE_DATABASE_INDEX`
- `fieldDisplayName` *(required)*: `string`
- `indexType`: `enum(BM25)` — Only needed when the field carries more than one index.
- `tableDisplayName` *(required)*: `string`

### `ADD_TABLE_EXTENSION`

Enable vector-embedding search on one TEXT field, using a model from GET_AVAILABLE_EMBEDDING_MODELS. Adds hidden embedding and token-count columns the backend maintains; use it when the app needs semantic search over that text rather than exact or prefix matching.
- `customEmbeddingId`: `string` — Embedding model id (from GET_AVAILABLE_EMBEDDING_MODELS); the platform default when omitted.
- `fieldDisplayName` *(required)*: `string` — Display name of the TEXT field to build the embedding index on.
- `tableDisplayName` *(required)*: `string`

### `UPDATE_TABLE_EXTENSION`

Change an existing vector-search extension, e.g. to a different embedding model. Re-embedding is done by the backend.
- `customEmbeddingId` *(required)*: `string` — Embedding model id (from GET_AVAILABLE_EMBEDDING_MODELS) to switch the index to; it is the only reconfigurable part of an extension.
- `fieldDisplayName` *(required)*: `string` — Display name of the field whose embedding index is reconfigured.
- `tableDisplayName` *(required)*: `string`

### `DELETE_TABLE_EXTENSION`

Remove a table's vector-search extension. The generated embedding columns and their stored vectors go with it.
- `fieldDisplayName` *(required)*: `string`
- `tableDisplayName` *(required)*: `string`

Then ship:

```bash
npx -y momen-mcp@2.7.8 schema validate && npx -y momen-mcp@2.7.8 project sync-backend
```
`project sync-backend` aborts with `SAVE_SCHEMA_WITHOUT_PATCHES` when nothing is pending — make at least one change before shipping.

## Notes & guardrails

- **Column type** goes in `typeIdentifier`, copied verbatim from `GET_TABLE_FIELD_SELECTABLE_TYPES` (on this project they look like `s:p:string`) — never assemble or guess one.
- The picker lists **primitives and enums only**, and returns the *concrete* type: `required` decides nullability, so never pass a `|null` union. A type it did not offer is rejected.
- **Destructive ops** (`DELETE_TABLES`, `DELETE_FIELDS_AND_RELATIONS`, `DELETE_CONSTRAINTS`) lose data; list what will be deleted and warn the user.
- **Type changes** aren't editable: delete + recreate the column.
- If results look stale, run `npx -y momen-mcp@2.7.8 schema reload`.
- **Enums / custom types** are out of scope here — see `schema-type.md`.

## Reading & writing deployed rows (runtime backend)

These verbs hit the **deployed** database, not the editor model, and take a single `--args` JSON blob (no per-field flags). `tableName` must be a real deployed table (`account`, your synced user tables, …); an unknown name fails server-side with `Unknown type '<name>_bool_exp'`.

```bash
npx -y momen-mcp@2.7.8 runtime query  --args '{"tableName":"post","where":{"id":{"_eq":1}},"limit":20,"fields":["id","title"]}'
npx -y momen-mcp@2.7.8 runtime insert --args '{"tableName":"post","objects":[{"title":"hi"}],"fields":["id"]}'
npx -y momen-mcp@2.7.8 runtime update --args '{"tableName":"post","where":{"id":{"_eq":1}},"set":{"title":"bye"}}'
npx -y momen-mcp@2.7.8 runtime delete --args '{"tableName":"post","where":{"id":{"_eq":1}}}'
```
- `insert` must supply every NOT-NULL column; object keys are the column **apiName** (what the schema read tools report).
- `update` / `delete` require `where` unless you pass `allowUpdateAll` / `allowDeleteAll=true`.
- `affected_rows` is authoritative; `returning` can be empty when row-level read permission hides the row.
